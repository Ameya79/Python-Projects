# Python-Projects
A collection of beginner-friendly Python terminal projects for practice and learning.
Perfect! Based on the 4 terminal-based projects you’ve uploaded (`Password Generator`, `Pizza Order`, `Rock Paper Scissors`, `Treasure Hunt`), here’s a polished `README.md` you can place in your GitHub repo.

## 🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly **Python terminal projects**!
Each project helped me learn and apply core Python concepts like `if/else`, loops, functions, user input, and logic building.

# 📁 Projects Included

1. 🔐 Password Generator

Generates a secure, randomized password based on the number of:

* **Letters**
* **Symbols**
* **Numbers**

What I learned:

* Using `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`
* List manipulation
* String joining and formatting

2. 🍕 Python Pizzeria

A simple pizza billing system that calculates the final price based on:

* Size (S, M, L)
* Add-ons like pepperoni or extra cheese

What I learned:

* `if`, `elif`, and `else` branching
* Nesting logic and cost computation
* Working with user input

3. ✊ Rock Paper Scissors

A terminal version of Rock, Paper, Scissors with:

* User input
* Computer-generated moves
* ASCII art display

What I learned:

* `random.randint()`
* Game condition logic
* Clean terminal I/O and input validation

4. 🏝️ Treasure Hunt

A multi-choice text-based adventure game where your choices affect the outcome.

What I learned:

* Nested conditionals
* Input handling with `.lower()`


💀 Hangman
Classic Hangman game with lives, guessing logic, and ASCII visuals.

What I learned:

* Game loops with while not game_over
* Tracking correct and repeated guesses
* Managing state (lives, display placeholders)
* Importing functions and data from external files (e.g. hangman_art.py, hangman_words.py)

### 📚 Skills Used Across Projects

#### 💡 Core Python Concepts:

* Variables and data types (`int`, `str`, `bool`, `list`)
* String formatting and concatenation (`f-strings`, `+`, `.join()`)
* User input handling with `input()` and type conversion (`int()`, `str()`)

#### 🔁 Control Flow & Logic:

* Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
* Nested conditionals and branching logic
* Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
* Looping with `for` and `while`
* Boolean flags and loop control (`game_over`, `lives`)

#### 🔀 Randomization:

* `random.choice()` to pick characters
* `random.shuffle()` to randomize password characters
* `random.randint()` for game mechanics

#### 🧩 Lists and Collections:

* Creating and modifying lists with `.append()` and indexing
* List slicing and reversing
* Membership checks (`if item in list`)

#### 🎮 Game Logic & Terminal I/O:

* ASCII art display using multi-line strings (`'''` or `"""`)
* User input validation and error handling (`if input not valid → exit`)
* Progressive game states (lives left, repeated guesses, etc.)

#### 📦 Modularity:

* Organizing code into **multiple files** (`hangman_art.py`, `hangman_words.py`)
* Importing and using external data (`import module_name`)
* Separating data, visuals, and logic for better structure

#### 🧠 Soft Skills Practiced:

* Problem-solving and debugging
* Understanding control flow and code tracing
* Clean code habits with comments and clear naming

### TL;DR:

💬 How to Run
All projects are pure terminal-based. Just run each `.py` file individually using Python 3/ Any IDE (Terminal)



🔧 Coming Soon

More beginner-friendly to intermediate projects like:
