## 🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly **Python terminal projects**!
Each project helped me learn and apply core Python concepts like `if/else`, loops, functions, user input, and logic building.

# 📁 Projects Included

1. 🔐 **Password Generator**
   Generates a secure, randomized password based on the number of:

* **Letters**
* **Symbols**
* **Numbers**

**What I learned:**

* Using `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`
* List manipulation
* String joining and formatting

---

2. 🍕 **Python Pizzeria**
   A simple pizza billing system that calculates the final price based on:

* Size (S, M, L)
* Add-ons like pepperoni or extra cheese

**What I learned:**

* `if`, `elif`, and `else` branching
* Nesting logic and cost computation
* Working with user input

---

3. ✊ **Rock Paper Scissors**
   A terminal version of Rock, Paper, Scissors with:

* User input
* Computer-generated moves
* ASCII art display

**What I learned:**

* `random.randint()`
* Game condition logic
* Clean terminal I/O and input validation

---

4. 🏝️ **Treasure Hunt**
   A multi-choice text-based adventure game where your choices affect the outcome.

**What I learned:**

* Nested conditionals
* Input handling with `.lower()`

---

5. 💀 **Hangman**
   Classic Hangman game with lives, guessing logic, and ASCII visuals.

**What I learned:**

* Game loops with `while not game_over`
* Tracking correct and repeated guesses
* Managing state (lives, display placeholders)
* Importing functions and data from external files (`hangman_art.py`, `hangman_words.py`)

---

6. 🏛️ **Caesar Cipher**
   An encryption tool that shifts letters of your message by a number you choose.

**What I learned:**

* Working with ASCII and `ord()/chr()`
* Handling wrap-around alphabet logic
* Creating reusable functions for encoding and decoding

---

7. 🧾 **Secret Bidding System**
   A digital blind auction system where users enter their bids anonymously.

**What I learned:**

* Using dictionaries to store name-bid pairs
* Finding the highest bid
* Looping until a condition is met (`while not end_of_bidding`)

---

8. ❤️ **Love Calculator**
   Takes two names and gives a fun "love score" based on common letters.

**What I learned:**

* String counting using `.count()`
* Basic numerical calculations with string manipulation
* Fun logic and terminal interaction

### 📚 Skills Used Across Projects

#### 💡 Core Python Concepts:

* Variables and data types (`int`, `str`, `bool`, `list`)
* String formatting and concatenation (`f-strings`, `+`, `.join()`)
* User input handling with `input()` and type conversion (`int()`, `str()`)

#### 🔁 Control Flow & Logic:

* Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
* Nested conditionals and branching logic
* Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
* Looping with `for` and `while`
* Boolean flags and loop control (`game_over`, `end_of_bidding`)

#### 🔀 Randomization:

* `random.choice()` to pick characters
* `random.shuffle()` to randomize password characters
* `random.randint()` for game mechanics

#### 🧩 Lists and Collections:

* Creating and modifying lists with `.append()` and indexing
* List slicing and reversing
* Membership checks (`if item in list`)
* Dictionary operations (`key: value` pairs)

#### 🎮 Game Logic & Terminal I/O:

* ASCII art display using multi-line strings (`'''` or `"""`)
* User input validation and error handling (`if input not valid → exit`)
* Progressive game states (lives left, repeated guesses, etc.)

#### 📦 Modularity:

* Organizing code into **multiple files** (`hangman_art.py`, `hangman_words.py`)
* Importing and using external data (`import module_name`)
* Separating data, visuals, and logic for better structure

#### 🧠 Soft Skills Practiced:

* Problem-solving and debugging
* Understanding control flow and code tracing
* Clean code habits with comments and clear naming

## 💬 How to Run

All projects are pure terminal-based.
Just run each `.py` file individually using **Python 3** in your IDE or terminal.

```bash
python project_name.py
```
